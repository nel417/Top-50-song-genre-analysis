# Top 50 songs of 2019 genre analysis

Research on what genres topped the charts this year, SPOILER ALERT: if you said rock...... you'll be disappointed
.

## Research


In this task I wanted to see what genres are making an impact and what the music industry is leaning towards these days.

## Tasks

1.) Analyzed data  
 
2.) Cleaned data by editing micro genres into a 
parent genre i.e(country rap: rap, Canadian pop: pop)  
 
3.) Figured which would be the best data to present on the y-axis, coming to the conclusion that number of songs from the list would be best fit


## Results
